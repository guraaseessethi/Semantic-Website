            Why is it important?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Semantic HTML provides many benefits to people, devices, and software reading our HTML documents, and how
            they're able to comprehend them.

        <h3>
            How to apply Semantic HTML to a document
        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by pasting just the text of the content into the body of a new HTML document
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Determine the major components of your content</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Main Header</strong> - What is your heading content?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Main</strong> - What is the main content?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Aside</strong> - This may be optional, but do you have content that doesn't fit
                        in the main area, but is still relevant?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Navigation</strong> - Do you have irrelevant content in your document that
                        belong on another page?
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once you determined the major components, determine if there are any sub-components</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For the main header, what is your major title? Do you have any slogans, tags, or phrases
                        you want to identify? Do you have a logo, an image, or an illustration you want to head
                        your document?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the main portion of your document, what is largest body of content that encapsulates
                        an idea or concept? Does it break down into paragraphs? Does it need sub sections to
                        break the content down even further. Do you need to organizational components such as
                        figures, lists, or tables, or perhaps interactive components like forms?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The aside is intended for relevant content but that doesn't necessarily fit directly
                        into the main idea. This can be broken down just like the main section; you can
                        determine if you require headings, sub sections, organizational structures, or even
                        interactive components
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The navigation needs to be a collection of links, and how they're structured has been
                        argued since the dawn of HTML 5. My personal preference is to use the nav tag and
                        encapsulate a list of links pointing to content pieces that are not relevant to the
                        current document
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now that you have your sub components, review your content and see if any further semantic
                    tweaking could help refine your content and provide more meaning</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Do you have any content that requires emphasis?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do you have quoted content, that needs citation?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do you want to quote content that you have in the same document?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do you want to stress the importance behind some content?
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>

        </ol>

            How does it help accessibility?
        </h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Structural, semantic HTML is the key starting point toward good accessibility practices.
                When a screen reader, or any sort of assistive device scans a web page, it gets information about the
                Document Object Model (DOM), or the HTML structure of the page. No styles or JavaScript will be read by
                a screen reader.

        <h2>Structured HTML and Semantic HTML Fall Hand-in-Hand</h2>
        <p>
            Structured HTML is the practice of formatting the HTML in the correct order of intended digestion. This
            means, that the content is organized in the order it was expected to be read.
